## Hi, Iâ€™m Aashi Patni ðŸ‘‹ 
A data enthusiast, storyteller, and lifelong learner currently pursuing my MS in Business Analytics at the University of Minnesota. I come from a Computer Science background, have experience in leading technical and placement committees, and Iâ€™ve always been the kind of person who gets just as excited about SQL queries as I do about a good basketball game (former state athlete, by the way).

I believe data isnâ€™t just numbers, itâ€™s insight, itâ€™s behavior, itâ€™s why things happen. Whether Iâ€™m helping a non-profit optimize logistics or building predictive models to identify premium users for a social music platform, I bring a problem-solving mindset, a sharp analytical toolkit, and just the right amount of caffeine.

Iâ€™ve worked across domains including business intelligence, marketing analytics, and financial modeling. I thrive in environments where curiosity meets impact. I speak fluent Python, SQL, R, Tableau, and Power BI, and I love translating data into decisions people can actually use.

When Iâ€™m not building dashboards or decoding datasets, you can find me cheering for my favorite teams, sipping coffee like it's a data ritual, or mentoring peers on their analytics journey.

Letâ€™s connect if youâ€™re looking for someone who brings grit, insight, and a human touch to analytics
Iâ€™m currently seeking opportunities in Data Science, Business Intelligence, and all-things-Analytics where I can help make data matter.
